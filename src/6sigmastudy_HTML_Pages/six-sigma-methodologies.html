    <h1>Six Sigma Methodologies    </h1>
    <p>There are mainly two methodologies of Six Sigma namely&nbsp;<strong>DMAIC</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>DMADV</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>DMAIC</strong>&nbsp;is  a data-driven Six Sigma methodology for improving existing products and  processes. The&nbsp;<strong>DMAIC</strong>&nbsp;process should be used when an existing  product or process can be improved to meet or exceed the customer&rsquo;s  requirements.&nbsp;<strong>DMAIC</strong>&nbsp;methodology consists of five phases: D –  Define, M – Measure, A – Analyze, I – Improve, C – Control.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define  – Define the project targets and customer (internal and external) deliverables.</li>
      <li>Measure  – Measure the process to determine the current process performance (baseline).</li>
      <li>Analyze  – Find out the root causes of the defects.</li>
      <li>Improve  – Improve the process by eliminating defects.</li>
      <li>Control  – Control the future performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>DMADV</strong>&nbsp;is  a common DFSS (Design for Six Sigma) methodology used to develop a process or  product which does not exist in the company. DFSS is an application of Six  Sigma which focuses on the design or redesigns of the different processes used  in product manufacturing or service delivery by taking into account the  customer needs and expectations.&nbsp;<strong>DMADV</strong>&nbsp;is used when the  existing product or process does not meet the level of customer specification  or Six Sigma level even after optimization with or without using&nbsp;<strong>DMAIC</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>DMAIC</strong>&nbsp;methodology  consists of five phases: D – Define, M – Measure, A – Analyze, D – Design, V –  Validate.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DEFINE  the project goals and customer deliverables</li>
      <li>MEASURE  the process to determine the current performance level</li>
      <li>ANALYZE  and determine the root causes of the defects</li>
      <li>DESIGN  the process in detail to meet customer needs</li>
      <li>VALIDATE  the design performance and its ability to meet the customer needs  </li></ul>
