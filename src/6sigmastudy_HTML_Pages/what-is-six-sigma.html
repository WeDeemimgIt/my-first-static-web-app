    <h1>What is Sig Sigma?</h1>
    <p>Six Sigma is a data driven, customer focused, and result  oriented methodology which uses statistical tools and techniques to  systematically eliminate the defects and inefficiencies to improve processes.  It is a systematic method to measure and analyze the business processes to  identify critical factors affecting business results, thereby improving the  processes and establishing controls around the improved processes.</p>
    <p>Six sigma is a widely accepted quality concept in the  corporate world today. Six Sigma started its journey in the 1980s as a data  driven method to reduce variation in electronic manufacturing processes in  Motorola Inc. in the USA. Six Sigma became famous when Jack Welch made it vital  to his successful business strategy at General Electric in 1995. Today it is  used as a business performance improvement methodology all over the world in  diverse industry including general manufacturing, construction, banking and  finance, healthcare, education, government, KPO/BPO, IT/ Software. At present  IT/ ITES sector companies are dynamically implementing Six Sigma and it is no  more confined into manufacturing sector</p>
    <p>The term &lsquo;six sigma&rsquo; comes from statistics and is used in  statistical quality control (SQC) which evaluates process capability i.e. the  numerical measure of the ability of a process to meet the customer  specifications. It was originated from terminology associated with  manufacturing which refers the ability of manufacturing process to produce a  very high proportion of output within specifications. The sigma rating of a  process indicates its yield or percentage of defect-free outputs it produces. A  six sigma process is the one which produces 99.99966% statistically defect-free  outputs which is equivalent to 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO).</p>
    <p>Six sigma uses a set of quality management and statistical  methods and creates a team of experts within the organization (Executive  Leadership, Champions, Black belt, Green Belt, Yellow Belt etc.) having  specific skill sets required to carry out the six sigma project. Each six sigma  project carried out within an organization follows a defined sequence of phases  with quantifiable value targets e.g. reduction in process cycle time, reduce  cost, increase in quality rating/ customer satisfaction index, reduction is defect  rate.</p>
    <h2>Road Map of a Six Sigma project:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Identify  the areas of improvement</li>
      <li>Define  the problem statement and goals for improvement in quantifiable terms (i.e.  which can be measured numerically)</li>
      <li>Determine  the resources required for the project</li>
      <li>Formulate  a project deliverables timeline in a phased manner</li>
      <li>Establish  performance parameters/ metrics</li>
      <li>Gather  baseline information about the process</li>
      <li>Validate  measurement system for the process output (Y)</li>
      <li>Examine  the data collected in the earlier phase to determine a prioritized list of  sources variation</li>
      <li>Explore  potential causes (potential X&rsquo;s for causation) and determine the impact of each  X has on the response Y</li>
      <li>Determine  the optimum level of vital few X&rsquo;s</li>
      <li>Validate  measurement system for X&rsquo;s</li>
      <li>Verify  process improvement</li>
      <li>Develop  control mechanism to ensure sustenance of the improved process</li>
    </ol>
     <h2>Some of benefits of Six Sigma are given below:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Six  Sigma helps companies to reduce cost and improve productivity</li>
      <li>Six  Sigma improves quality of projects output by reduction of inefficiencies and  defects</li>
      <li>Six  Sigma increases customer satisfaction, and loyalty</li>
      <li>Certified  Six Sigma Professionals can help increasing ROI significantly</li>
